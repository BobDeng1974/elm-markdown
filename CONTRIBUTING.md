# Contributing to `dillonkearns/elm-markdown`

Thanks for taking a look at this document!

The Github-Flavored Markdown spec is huge so I would very much appreciate community contributions for this project!

Before diving into a pull request, here are some things to keep in mind:

- Make sure you're familiar with [this project's philosophy and goals](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-markdown#philosophy--goals)
- In particular, keep in mind that this project prioritizes **helpful errors** over fault-tolerance whenever there is a tradeoff between the two

## Finding a good place to contribute

Two great places to start looking for places to contribute:

- [Open issues](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-markdown) (especially [ones marked _good first issue_](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-markdown/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22))
- Take a look at the [current failures for the Github-Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-markdown/tree/master/test-results/failing/GFM) (the output is super easy to read and includes links to the relevant section in the GFM Spec)

## Running the Tests

### Unit Tests

There is a suite of Elm unit tests in the `tests` folder.

Run those with

```shell
npm test
```

Or you can watch the tests with

```shell
npm run autotest
```

### End-to-end tests

You can see the current result of the end-to-end tests by running

```shell
npm run test:ete # this will fail
```

Note that this will have several failures and a non-zero exit status. When you make a change, what you want to do is make sure that there are no **new failures** (i.e. regressions). To do this, you can simply `git diff` the `spec-results.json` file

```
git diff spec-results.json
```

If there is any red, it means a test that had been passing has now started to fail ðŸ›‘

If there is green, that means a new test has started to pass! âœ… ðŸŽ‰

Just be sure that the diff only has new passing tests added, and none removed, and you're in good shape! You can commit the new `spec-results.json` file whenever you get new tests passing.
